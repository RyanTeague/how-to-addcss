    <!--How To Add CSS
    
        When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document
        according to the information in the style sheet.

    <!--Three Ways to insert CSS
    
        There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

            .External CSS
            .Internal CSS
            .inline CSS
    -->

    <!--External CSS
    
        With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website
        by changing just one file!

        Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file
        inside the <link> element, inside of the head section.

        Example
        External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head>
        section of an HTML page:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
        </head>
        <body>

        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        </body>
        </html>

        An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved
        with a .css extension.

        The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

        Here is how "style.css" file looks
